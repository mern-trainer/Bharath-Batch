=> React -> JavaScript library for building user interfaces
=> ReactDOM => JavaScript library for working with the DOM

=> Reconcilation => The process of comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM 
                    and updating the real DOM to match the virtual DOM 
                    using the library such as ReactDOM.
